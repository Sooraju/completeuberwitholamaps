Designed and implemented an Uber-like ride-hailing web application featuring real-time driverâ€“rider matching, live location tracking, and trip state updates. 
Built the frontend using React and Tailwind CSS, and the backend with Node.js/Express. 
Integrated Socket.IO for real-time events and Ola Maps API for maps, routing, and ETA/fare calculations.
